# Making Replication Packages Usable (Again)

## General Information

You are a researcher working on software-engineering topics or a practitioner interested in current tools from software-engineering research? Did you make the experience of trying to reuse a software artifact from a software-engineering research paper and failing to execute it? Or did your replicated results diverge significantly from what was reported in the respective paper? Do you want to help improve replication packages so that you do not have to spend hours on getting the software to run?

Then, join our *in-person* hackathon *"Making Replication Packages Usable (Again)"* on December 2 at PROFES 2024 in Tartu, Estonia. Organized by Sebastian Nielebock (Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany), Jacob Kr√ºger (Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands), and Alexander Nolte (Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands and Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), we want to explore together with you what makes replication packages hard to (re-)use and what can be improved.

This is a replication of a prior hackathon that was held as an adjacent event to the German Conference for Research Software Engineering ([https://go.uniwue.de/derse24](https://go.uniwue.de/derse24)) on March 7, 2024.

## How to join

3. Attend the hackathon at PROFES 2024 on December 2nd and make replication packages work (Note: *Own laptops are required for the Hackathon!*)

## Important dates

* __Registration deadline:__ September 21, 2024
* __Workshop:__ December 2, 2024

We will *invite all interested participants* who contributed feasible solutions to join us in *writing a collaborative experience report on the Hackathon's outcomes*.

Further details on the exact time and location hackathon will be available on the PROFES 2024 webpage ([https://conf.researchr.org/home/profes-2024](https://conf.researchr.org/home/profes-2024)) closer to the conference.

Hope to see you in Tartu!
Alexander, Jacob, and Sebastian
