# Making Replication Packages Usable (Again)

## General Information

You are a researcher working on software-engineering topics or a practitioner interested in current tools from software-engineering research? Did you make the experience of trying to reuse a software artifact from a software-engineering research paper and failing to execute it? Or did your replicated results diverge significantly from what was reported in the respective paper? Do you want to help improve replication packages so that you do not have to spend hours on getting the software to run?

Then, join our *in-person* Hackathon *"Making Replication Packages Usable (Again)"* in December (specific date and time tba)  of the PROFES conference 2024  Tartu, Estonia. Organized by Sebastian Nielebock (Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany), Jacob Kr√ºger (Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands), and Alexander Nolte (Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands and Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), we want to explore together with you what makes replication packages hard to (re-)use and what can be improved.

What to do to join:

1. Register for PROFES 2024 registration details can be found on the website [https://conf.researchr.org/attending/profes-2024/registration](https://conf.researchr.org/attending/profes-2024/registration)
2. Drop a mail to Alexander (a.u.nolte [at] tue.nl), Jacob (j.kruger [at] tue.nl), and Sebastian (sebastian.nielebock [at] ovgu.de) that you want to attend the Hackathon
3. Attend PROFES 2024 from December 2nd to 4th and make replication packages work (Note: *Own laptops are required for the Hackathon!*)

We will *invite all interested participants* who contributed feasible solutions to join us in *writing a collaborative experience report on the Hackathon's outcomes*.

Further details on the Hackathon can be found on the PROFES 2024 webpage: TBA

Hope to see you in Tartu\
Alexander, Jacob, and Sebastian
